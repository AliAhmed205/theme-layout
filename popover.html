                <h3>The Transition Popover</h3>
                <p>Browsers can't smoothly animate certain changes yet, like making things appear or disappear
                    smoothly. But, in an upcoming version of Chromium (the engine behind Chrome), they're planning to
                    add this feature. When it's available, developers can use it to create smoother transitions when
                    opening and closing popovers. This will make websites feel more polished and easier to use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once this feature is added, developers can make things move smoothly on the screen using special
                    instructions like ":popover-open" and "@starting-style". They can also set up how things look before
                    and after they move, so that the transitions between popovers are really smooth. This makes the
                    website or app feel nicer to use because everything moves more gracefully.
                </p>

                <h3>The Static Popover</h3>
                <p>By default, such as in the previous code snippet, setting up a popover with a popovertarget means the
                    button or element that opens the popover will toggle it open and closed. However, you can also
                    create explicit popovers using popovertargetaction. This overrides the default toggle action.
                    popovertargetaction options include: popovertargetaction="show": Shows the popover.
                    popovertargetaction="hide": Hides the popover.
                </p>

                <h3>Anchor Positioning</h3>
                <p>Anchor positioning
                    Popovers are handy when you need to place an alert, modal, or notification depending on the screen.
                    But they're also great for menus, tooltips, and things that should be placed near other elements.
                    That's where CSS anchoring helps.

                    In the example below, we use the popover tool together with CSS anchoring to make sure that the
                    popover #menu-items is always connected to its toggle button, the #menu-toggle button.
                </p>
