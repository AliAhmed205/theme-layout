                <h2>Stephan</h2>
                <p>This fella went for <b>GRID</b>. It's not like he had any other option considering the fact that he
                    uses a bankrupt browser :)</p>

                <h2>Jop</h2>
                <p>His JOB was understanding <b>TASTY SNACKS</b>. I'm not talking about candies and sweets. Honestly, I

                <h2>Ali</h2>
                <p>Now this one's a REAL gamechanger. Not a character of JavaScript is found in this bad-boy. Ali went
                    for the <b>POPOVER</b> functionality. Ironic for someone who doesn't even know how he functions
                    himself but regardless. Feast your eyes on this CSS-wonder.</p>
